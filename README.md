# Abstractive Summarization

This is an interesting and challenging project. The applications fascinate me to keep pursuing to solve the problem.

**[B-K-A]** BACKGROUND-KNOWLEDGE-APPLICATION <br>
The learning process of humans can be broadly categorized
in three parts:
1. **Background:**  
We need to have some background
information of what we are trying to learn. These can
be backed with facts, assumptions, theories and belief
systems. All this is essential part of our memory and
intelligence.  
2. **Knowledge:**  
We derive many kinds of inferences,
judgement, understanding of the data in hand and try
to visualize and extract some information. Later these
extracts/excerpts are formalized for further use. Also,
we should know that not everything is ground truth and
may change in future.  
3. **Applications:**  
Whatever we have assimilated, we use
that to derive new results and conclusions of unseen
data.



### Applications of Abstractive Summarization technology
Following are some the real-life applications thought by me:
1. **[Daily short and important news]** We would like to be update as
quickly as possible with the current aairs with facts
and gures as per our needs. eg. Inshorts. 
2. **[Summarizing for different groups]** There are groups
(eg. age, degree) of different intelligence and
knowledge. The same content can be summarized in
various ways to suit the need of a group.
3. **[Auto-Knowledge Staircase]** The entire subject matter related to some specific topic can be summarized and slowly presented in depth to a user depending on one's learning pace and expertise.
